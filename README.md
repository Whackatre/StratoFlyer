StratoFlyer
===========
A simple 2D space shooter built for educational purposes.
Written by myself, Whackatre (Justin Zeng)

Additional credits go to:
- various internet sources for various utility methods.
- various graphic artists for their sprites and backgrounds.

You can contact me on my forums which are located at http://skyrealm.net/smf or via my IRC channel (#skyrealm at irc.gyrat.in), but you may occasionally find me in other IRC networks.

This project is for educational purposes and for fun; if you would like to contribute in any form, feel free to create a pull request! ;)
